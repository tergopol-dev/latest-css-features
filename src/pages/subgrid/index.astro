  <p>
    Subgrid is a new value for the <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code
      >grid-template-rows</code
    >
    properties. It allows the child elements of a grid container to use the same
    grid definition as the parent, without having to define the grid again.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you add <code>display: grid</code> to a grid container, only the direct
    children become grid items and can then be placed on the grid you created. The
    children of these items display in normal flow. You can "nest" grids by making
    a grid item a grid container. These grids, however, are independent of the parent
    grid and of each other, meaning that they do not take their track sizing from
    the parent grid. This makes it difficult to line nested grid items up with the
    main grid.
