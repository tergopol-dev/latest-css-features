      CSS specificity is the mechanism by which CSS determines which styles to
      apply to elements. The specificity of a style rule is determined by the
      selectors used. For instance, elements have lower specificity compared to
      classes or attributes, which in turn have lower specificity compared to
      IDs. Understanding CSS specificity is fundamental to mastering CSS.

    <p>
      Cascade Layers in CSS (using the <code>@layer</code> CSS rule) provide a powerful
      syntax that influences the styling hierarchy of a set of styles. Layers can
      be named and ordered (if not explicitly ordered, they follow the source order).
      Styles in higher layers always take precedence over styles in lower layers,
      regardless of selector specificity. Styles outside of layers have the highest
      priority. This system introduces a new layer to the CSS cascade. With layered
      styles, the precedence of a layer always supersedes the specificity of a selector.
